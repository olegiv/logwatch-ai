# Release Notes - Version 1.1.0

**Release Date**: October 24, 2025
**Release Type**: Minor Release (Feature Update)

---

## üéâ Overview

Version 1.1.0 introduces **prompt caching** for Claude API calls, resulting in **16-30% cost savings** per analysis. This release also includes enhanced AI prompts for improved analysis quality and better logging for cost monitoring.

---

## ‚ú® What's New

### Prompt Caching Implementation

The headline feature of v1.1.0 is server-side prompt caching, which dramatically reduces API costs:

- **Cost Reduction**: 16-30% savings per analysis
- **Monthly Savings**: ~$0.12 per month per server (~20% reduction)
- **Multi-Server Benefits**: Up to 27% total savings when running on multiple servers within 5-minute windows
- **Zero Configuration**: Works automatically, no setup required

#### How It Works

- Static system prompt (~1,590 tokens) is cached on Anthropic's servers
- Cache is shared across all API calls using the same API key
- Cache lasts 5 minutes from last access (auto-refreshes)
- First request creates cache, subsequent requests read from cache
- Cache reads cost 90% less than standard input tokens

#### Cost Breakdown

**Single Server:**
- Without cache: ~$0.0195 per analysis
- With cache: ~$0.0154 per analysis
- Savings: $0.0041 per analysis (21% reduction)

**10-Server Deployment (within 5-minute window):**
- Without cache: $0.2200 total
- With cache: $0.1606 total
- Savings: $0.0594 (27% reduction)

### Enhanced AI Analysis

- Expanded system prompt from ~320 to ~1,590 tokens
- Comprehensive analysis framework with detailed guidelines
- Improved security threat detection criteria
- Better system health assessment rubrics
- More actionable recommendations
- Enhanced metrics extraction

### Improved Logging

- Cache creation and read statistics in logs
- Real-time cost savings calculations
- Percentage reduction reporting
- Token usage breakdown (cache vs standard)

### API Changes

**Before (v1.0.0):**
```javascript
messages: [
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: prompt  // Single combined prompt
  }
]
```

**After (v1.1.0):**
```javascript
system: [
  {
    type: 'text',
    text: systemPrompt,
    cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }  // Cached
  }
],
messages: [
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: userPrompt  // Dynamic content
  }
]
```

## üìà Performance Impact

### Response Times
- No significant change in response times
- Cache creation: ~12-15 seconds (first run)
- Cache hits: ~10-14 seconds (similar to v1.0.0)

### Token Usage
- Typical analysis without cache: ~2,400-2,900 total tokens
- Typical analysis with cache: ~2,400-2,900 total tokens (same)
- Cache reads: ~1,559 tokens at 90% discount

## üöÄ Upgrade Instructions

### Automatic Upgrade (Git)

```bash
cd /opt/logwatch-ai  # or your installation path
git pull
npm install  # Update dependencies if needed
```

### Manual Upgrade

1. Backup your current installation:
   ```bash
   cp -r /opt/logwatch-ai /opt/logwatch-ai-backup
   ```

2. Replace these files:
   - `src/claude-client.js`
   - `src/utils/prompts.js`

3. Test the upgrade:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm start
   ```

4. Check logs for cache statistics:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/app.log | grep -E "Cache|savings"
   ```

### Verification

After upgrading, run the analyzer twice within 5 minutes:

```bash
npm start
sleep 30
npm start
```

Check logs for cache hit confirmation:
```
[INFO] Cache - Created: 1559 tokens, Read: 0 tokens  # First run
[INFO] Cache - Read: 1559 tokens                     # Second run
[INFO] Cache savings: $0.0042 (21.4% reduction)     # Savings reported
```

## üéØ Migration Guide

### For Single Server Deployments

**No action required.** Update the code and enjoy automatic cost savings.

### For Multi-Server Deployments

To maximize savings:

1. **Orchestrate runs within 5-minute windows:**
   ```bash
   # Example: Stagger starts by 30 seconds
   server1: 0 6 * * * /opt/logwatch-ai/run.sh
   server2: 0 6 * * * sleep 30 && /opt/logwatch-ai/run.sh
   server3: 0 6 * * * sleep 60 && /opt/logwatch-ai/run.sh
   ```

2. **Use parallel execution:**
   ```bash
   # Run all servers simultaneously (cache sharing)
   parallel-ssh -h servers.txt -i '/opt/logwatch-ai/run.sh'
   ```

3. **Monitor cache hits:**
   ```bash
   # Verify cache sharing is working
   grep "Cache - Read" logs/app.log
   ```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Maximize Cache Benefits

1. **Run retries quickly**: If analysis fails, retry within 5 minutes to use cache
2. **Batch server runs**: Run multiple servers within 5-minute window
3. **Monitor logs**: Watch for cache statistics to verify savings
4. **Keep prompts stable**: Don't modify system prompts frequently

### Cost Monitoring

```bash
# Daily cost summary
grep "Estimated cost" logs/app.log | tail -30

# Cache hit rate
grep "Cache - Read" logs/app.log | wc -l

# Total savings this month
grep "Cache savings" logs/app.log | \
  awk '{sum += $4} END {print "Total saved: $" sum}'
```
